## Interactive Piano Game

<p><b>Reasoning/Motivation</b>
<li>I love listening to music and enjoy playing games where I am able to play my favorite songs. Therefore, I decided to create a game in which users can "play" the piano using their computer keyboards. I have seen similar games in the past where users could play on a digital keyboard by clicking but wanted to create a more natural experience closer to the experience of playing an actual piano.</li>
