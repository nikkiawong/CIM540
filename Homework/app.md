The Dog Door App allows dog owners to remotely open doors for their dogs, providing the perfect solution for busy individuals whose dogs need to be let outside at regular intervals throughout the day. A special chip in the dog's collar is detected by a chip on the door, sending a notification to the owner's phone. The owner will then be given the option to open the door with just a push of a button, as well as close and lock the door in the same way. Additionally, the app features a camera feature, giving owners a glimpse of their dog during the day while they are at work, school, or just out and about.
